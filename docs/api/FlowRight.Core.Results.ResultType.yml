  summary: >-
    Specifies the general category or severity level of a result, providing high-level classification

    for success states and various types of informational or error conditions.
  remarks: >-
    <p>

    This enumeration provides a way to categorize results beyond simple success/failure,

    allowing for more nuanced result handling in scenarios where different types of

    non-failure outcomes need to be distinguished.

    </p>

    <p>

    The values are ordered by severity, with <xref href="FlowRight.Core.Results.ResultType.Success" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> representing the most

    positive outcome and <xref href="FlowRight.Core.Results.ResultType.Error" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> representing the most severe negative outcome.

  assemblies:

  summary: >-
    Indicates that the operation completed successfully without any issues.

    This is the most positive result state and typically contains a success value.

  summary: >-
    Indicates that the operation completed successfully and provides additional

    informational content that may be useful to the caller or end user.
  remarks: >-
    This result type is useful for operations that succeed but want to communicate

    additional context, such as warnings about deprecated features, informational

    messages about data transformations, or notifications about side effects.
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: Information = 1
    return:
      type: FlowRight.Core.Results.ResultType

    startLine: 45
  assemblies:
  - FlowRight.Core
  namespace: FlowRight.Core.Results
  summary: >-
    Indicates that the operation completed successfully but encountered conditions

    that warrant attention or may lead to issues in the future.
  remarks: >-
    Warning results are successful but highlight potential problems, configuration

    issues, or situations that should be addressed. For example, using deprecated

    APIs, approaching resource limits, or data quality concerns.
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: Warning = 2

  assemblies:
  - FlowRight.Core
  namespace: FlowRight.Core.Results
  summary: >-
    Indicates that the operation failed to complete successfully due to an error condition.

    This represents a failure state and typically contains error information instead of a success value.
  remarks: >-
    Error results represent various types of failures including system errors, validation

    failures, security violations, and business rule violations. The specific type of

    error can be determined using <xref href="FlowRight.Core.Results.ResultFailureType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref>.

    content: Error = 3
