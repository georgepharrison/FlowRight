  summary: >-
    Specifies the specific type of failure that occurred in a result operation,

    providing detailed categorization for different error scenarios and enabling

    appropriate error handling strategies.
  remarks: >-
    <p>

    This enumeration allows consumers to distinguish between different categories

    of failures and implement specific handling logic for each type. For example,

    validation failures might be displayed to users differently than security failures.

    </p>

    <p>

    The failure types are designed to align with common error scenarios in modern

    applications, including validation, security, and operation lifecycle concerns.

    Indicates a general error condition that doesn't fall into other specific categories.

    This represents system errors, unexpected exceptions, or business rule violations.
  remarks: >-
    This is the default failure type for most error scenarios including:

    <ul><li>System or infrastructure failures</li><li>Unexpected exceptions</li><li>Business logic violations</li><li>General application errors</li></ul>

  summary: >-
    Indicates a security-related failure such as authentication failures,

    authorization violations, or security policy breaches.
  remarks: >-
    Security failures typically require special handling and may need to be:

    <ul><li>Logged to security audit trails</li><li>Reported to security monitoring systems</li><li>Handled with specific error messages that don't reveal sensitive information</li><li>Subject to rate limiting or account lockout policies</li></ul>

  summary: >-
    Indicates that the operation failed due to validation errors in the input data,

    typically containing detailed field-level error information.
  remarks: >-
    Validation failures are commonly encountered in user-facing applications and APIs.

    They typically:

    <ul><li>Contain detailed field-specific error messages</li><li>Can be displayed directly to users</li><li>Should not be logged as system errors</li><li>May include multiple validation errors for different fields</li></ul>

    The detailed validation errors are typically available through <xref href="FlowRight.Core.Results.IResult.Failures" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref>.
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: Validation = 3

  assemblies:

  summary: >-
    Indicates that the requested resource was not found or does not exist.

    This represents a client error where the resource does not exist

    or the client lacks permission to access it.
  remarks: >-
    Not found failures are common in REST APIs and data access scenarios.

    They typically:

    <ul><li>Correspond to HTTP 404 status codes</li><li>Indicate that a specific resource or entity does not exist</li><li>Can be handled differently from general errors</li><li>May trigger fallback or alternative data retrieval strategies</li></ul>

    This failure type allows consumers to distinguish between actual errors

    and legitimate "not found" scenarios that may be expected during normal operation.
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: NotFound = 4
    return:
      type: FlowRight.Core.Results.ResultFailureType

    startLine: 111
  assemblies:
  - FlowRight.Core
  namespace: FlowRight.Core.Results
  summary: >-
    Indicates that the operation failed due to a server-side error, typically

    representing 5xx HTTP status codes or infrastructure-related failures.
  remarks: >-
    Server errors represent failures on the server side that are typically temporary

    and may be resolved with retry mechanisms or service recovery:

    <ul><li>Correspond to HTTP 5xx status codes (500-599)</li><li>Include internal server errors, service unavailable, bad gateway, etc.</li><li>May be candidates for retry logic with exponential backoff</li><li>Should be monitored and potentially trigger alerts</li><li>Distinguished from client errors to enable appropriate handling strategies</li></ul>
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: ServerError = 5
    return:
      type: FlowRight.Core.Results.ResultFailureType
- uid: FlowRight.Core.Results.ResultFailureType.OperationCanceled

    startLine: 127
  assemblies:
  - FlowRight.Core
  namespace: FlowRight.Core.Results
  summary: >-
    Indicates that the operation was canceled before completion, typically due to

    cancellation tokens, timeouts, or explicit user cancellation requests.
  remarks: >-
    Operation canceled failures represent a normal part of application flow control

    rather than actual errors. They may be handled differently from other failure types:

    <ul><li>Often ignored in logging</li><li>May not be displayed to users as errors</li><li>Can be filtered out of error handling in some scenarios</li><li>Support graceful shutdown and timeout scenarios</li></ul>

    content: OperationCanceled = 6
